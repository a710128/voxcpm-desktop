# Agent Rules

## MOST IMPORTANT RULES

- DO NOT modify AGENTS.md unless the user permits it by explicitly asking you to do so.
- DO NOT consider about the compatibility. This project is under development now, not being deployed yet.
- When you adding new feature or fixing a bug, please consider about how to minimize the impact on the existing code, which means modify codes as less as possible.
- When you want to ask user for making decisions, if there is a `question` tool or `ask_user` tool, prefer to use it instead of asking the user directly. If there is no suitable tool, ask the user directly.
- Before making any changes, write a TODO list to remind yourself to implement the features later, if there is a `todo` tool, prefer to use it instead of writing the TODO list manually.
- Before you start writing code, you need to inform the user of the solution you intend to adopt. Only after discussing and confirming with the user should you begin the work.


## Git Commit Message Style

The git commit message style should be composed of two parts: title and body. The title should be `<type>: <subject>` (such as `feat: add new feature` or `fix: fix bug`). The body should be the detailed description of the changes in list format.

It's important that DO NOT include any symbol like $ or ` in the title or body. This would cause the bash shell to interpret the title or body as a command or a code block.
